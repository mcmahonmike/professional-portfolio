# Professional Portfolio

## Overview
A simplely structured portfolio created to showcase some completed coding projects as well as place holders for future projects and also providing information about who I am and contact my contact information.

## Navigation

The navigation section on the professional profile provides clickable links to the **ABOUT ME** section, the **MY WORK** section, and the **CONTACT INFO** section while also displaying my first and last name.

## About Me

About me provides an image of myself and a small description of who I am and what coding experience that I have.

## My Work

My work section is laid out as five flexboxes built to show a preview of the coding projects I have completed with clickable links that lead to the published projects. The **Run Buddy** project is built as a larger flex box above four smaller projects that are placeholders for additonal projects to be added to them in the future.

Each flexbox has the `:hover` selector applied to the CSS to provide a dynamic view that raises the opacity from 0.5 to 1.0.

The flexboxes also have descriptors inside that display the title of the project and the coding language used to create them.

## Contact Info

Within the Contact Info section provides my current email address, a clickable link to my GitHub page, a clickable link to my Linkdn profile, and my current cell phone number.

## Video Demo 

Below I have provided a short demo video to show the completed Professional Portfolio and to demonstrate how the use of media queries adjusts the content of the page to be viewed better on screens of different sizes.
